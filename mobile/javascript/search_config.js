Pixel Dimensions and Printed Image Resolution           Pixel dimensions measure the total number of pixels along an          image’s width and height. Resolution is the fineness of detail in a          bitmap image and is measured in pixels per inch (ppi). The more          pixels per inch, the greater the resolution. Generally, an image          with a higher resolution produces a better printed image quality.
